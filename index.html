                <h3><a href="http://tusenfryd.no">Tusenfryd</a></h3>
                <ul id="list">
                    <li><h4>Title:</h4>
                    <p>The sites titles are set up in a way that distinguises the different pages on the website. It also easy to know the current page you are on, and within the Tusenfryd website. The way it's set up is with "Current page you are on | Tusenfryd". This is easy to read, and seems to us as a good and clean solution.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Image/text alternatives:</h4>
                    <p>We discovered that some images has an alt-tag describing the image, while some didn't. This seems inconsistent and does not follow the HTML convention. However the images that had an alt-tag was well described and it would be easy for someone who couldn't see the image, to understand the meaning of the image.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Headings:</h4>
                    <p>Our discoveries show that the page has inconsistent use of headings. The main header is an H1-tag. However, some sections start with and H2- or H3-tag, but subheaders are made with p- or a-tags. This does not follow a meaningful heading-hierarchy. There are also elements that looks like headings, that are marked as p-tags.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Contrast ratio:</h4>
                    <p>The contrast between text and background generally seems consistent. The information part of the page uses black text on a white background, which is acceptable. In the header, the text is white on a pink background. It's easy to distinguish between the two, but it seems a bit tireing for the eyes to look at. It might also be a hard to interpret the page as a whole, due to the use of alot of different, bright colors that easily catches the eye.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Resize text:</h4>
                    <p>The page scales very well. It's no problem to zoom in or out. No text gets cut of, or overlaps. All the buttons and field are still visible. The images and text on them also scales like the rest of the page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Keyboard access and visual focus:</h4>
                    <p><i>On a Mac with Safari</i> we were only able to tab through forms and input fields. The navigation bar were not available. <i>On a Windows with Firefox</i> we were able reach the navigation bar, however there were no visual feedback telling which element was selected. As a test we tried order tickets online without using a mouse, but this proved to be impossible. In conclusion this website does not support good keyboard access.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Forms, labels and errors:</h4>
                    <p>Some forms are possible to tab through, while some, for example the date selection is not accessible with a keyboard. There are not displayed any error messages if you try to order zero tickets, it just reloads the form. All the labels follow the convention for left-to-right languages. However the labels are made with H5-tags, not label-tags and thus doesen't have the attributes. The form fields does not have anything indicating that it is mandatory. Considering that there is no error handling either, this might seem rather unintuitive to a novice user.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Multimedia alternatives:</h4>
                    <p> Other than images, there are surprisingly few multimedia objects on the site. As we discussed before, many of the images does not have an alt tag. The few videoes we could find on the website, which were of the different attractions in the park, had a description of the attraction next to it. The videos are links to youtube.com, and the media player is accessible by keyboard, and also has support for captions and other important options.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Basic structure check</h4>
                    <p>After removing the CSS and the images from the website, it doesen't really make sense anymore. Some of the text is correctly placed under its parent header, others are seemingly randomly placed. As a whole, the main page is not in any way split into the different sections. The alt tags are mostly empty, and does not display any useful information about the picture, as discussed before. The form for ordering tickets does not work at all, it is possible to select the number of tickets and the number of days, but we could not find any way of proceeding to the next step in the ordering process. </p>

                <ul id="list">
                    <li><h4>Title:</h4>
                    <p>The start of the title field is decently set up for all the pages on the site. It's a description of the current page on the site. After that though, the title field has a very long description of the last news posted on the main page. This makes it a really long title, which really doesen't make any sense. A title describing the website, and the current page would be much more fitting, and easier to read.</p>                    
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Image/text alternatives:</h4>
                    <p>None of the images we found on the website has an alt tag at all. This does not follow the HTML convention, and nothing will be seen if the image isn't loaded.</p>                    
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Headings:</h4>
                    <p>There is no consistency regarding the use of headers on the site. Some elements is marked as a header, and some are simply wrapped in a span with inline css describing the size and font of the text. The headers does not follow any hierarchy either, some of the pages uses h1 under another h1, which results in a layout where the two aren't separated.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Contrast ratio:</h4>
                    <p>The use of colors are consistent and nice on the site. Black text on a white background is used for information and red on a light blue background for the right navigation bar. The current site you are on is also colored in red in the navigation bar, which makes it more clear, and easier to use. The only bad thing is the default color of the navigation bar, which is light blue and looks too much like the site background. </p>                    
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Resize text:</h4>
                    <p>There is no scaling evident in the standard format of the website. Text and pictures remain the same when changing the size of the window. However when viewed on a mobile device the website automatically scales to mobile screen sizes. The mobile site is quite different from the desktop version.</p>                    
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Keyboard access and visual focus:</h4>
                    <p><i>Using Firefox on a Windows computer</i>, not using a mouse worked surprisingly well on the site. It was possible to navigate to all of the elements on the page, as well as fill in and send the few available forms. We found no problems navigating around on the different pages on the site, the current site that was tabbed over was also visualy availible. <i>Using Mac and Safari</i>, the navigation weren't as good. All we were able to do, was navigating to the form fields and filling out and sending those. It was not possible to access the navigation bar, which is crucial. </p> 
                    <li><h4>Forms, labels and errors:</h4>
                    <p>The only form on the webpage is a "Recommend page to a friend"-form. This form has error handling, because it checks if the entered email address is valid, and alerts the user with a popup box if it isn't. The form has no labels, only placeholder text. The form fields does not yield whether they are mandatory or not.</p>                    
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Multimedia alternatives:</h4>
                    <p>The site has several different multimedia objects. These objects are primarily images and slideshows. The slideshow starts playing automatically when opening the website and can be paused or manually operated by the user. There is also some videos on the website, these videos use youtube.com and its web player. The website has a good amount of images that describe the attractions they are offering, the images however are small and the zoom option is not sufficient as it on most of the pictures display the same image size.</p>                    
                    <li><h4>Basic structure check</h4>
                    <p>Without the CSS and images showing on the website, it still remains structured and it's easy to access the different parts of the website. The structure of the site is well built and remains so throughout the website.</p>

            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>Originally we thought that tusenfryd.no would be the better of the two websites, however we have after the analysis come to a conclusion that the quality of the website depends on more than the first look. Both of the websites have several faults in both their design and structure, and therefore it is not evident what website comes out on top. Tusenfryd.no does indeed look a lot better at first sight and has more options for scaling than skarneslekeland.no, but it is lacking on several key functionalities that makes the site easier to use.</p>

			<h2>Project draft</h2>
			<p> In this project, our plan is to design a website for a fictive theme park. The goal of the
site, will be to show potential customers the attractions and event in the park, as well as system allowing 
us to sell tickets online. We also want to include a map, and general information about the park, in a way 
that's easily understandable by our customers.</p>

			<p> This fictive park has 6 attractions. We want to have a page for each of these attractions, which 
includes a picture, as well as information about the ride. There will also be a main page, which will consist of general 
information of the park, a map of the park, and a site map at the bottom of the web page. There will also be pages 
for our restaurant, contact page and events happening at the park. We also need a ticket page, which will show 
ticket prices and allow you to order tickets online. Lastly, we will have a page with information about 
renting the park for parties, birthdays and so on. To sum up, these are the sites and their respective titles. </p>
			
			<ul class="draftlist" id="list">
				<li> InsertParkName - Main page </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Attraction1 </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Attraction2  </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Attraction3  </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Attraction4  </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Attraction5  </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Attraction6  </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Contact Information </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Restaurant </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Events </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Tickets </li>
				<li> InsertParkName - Rent the park </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p> The attraction pages will be placed linearly in the hierarchy. The "Rent the park" page will be 
placed as a subpage to the Ticket page. Other than that, the other pages will serve as independent pages.
			<p> The site will mainly be targeted to families and young people. This will clearly influence 
our design decisions regarding the website. We don't consider old people to be part of the targeted age 
group. While some may want to visit, we don't see it as a major part of our visitor group. It is however, 
important to us to design the site so that it is available to a wide group of people. We generally don't want to 
exclude anyone that wants to visit our website. Therefore, the use of keyboard features and easy to 
navigate pages is important to us. </p>
			<p> The site will mainly contain pictures and text to describe the different attractions we offer. 
There will also be implemented a map, to show where the park is located. This, along with a general description, 
will allow people to easily locate the park. </p>
			<p> The site will have a contact page, which will allow a visitor to fill inn a form, and 
send a mail to us. We will also implement a slideshow on the main page, allowing the user to watch 
pictures of the different attractions. MER DYNAMISKE FUNSKJONER PLOX I DNT KNOW</p>
			<p> The pictures and other media content, will be randomly selected pictures of different theme 
park rides. All of the code will be written by us, and we will avoid the use of frameworks, such as Bootstrap 
and Wordpress. Other than that, the text on the site will be written by us, and although this may take some 
time, the main focus will be on the design and implementation.</p>
			<p> From analyzing skarneslekeland.no and tusenfryd.no, we discovered just how many things to 
consider when designing a website. It will be important to us to make sure we design a site that is available 
for everyone. We also learned that many websites look good at a first glance, they could have been better 
structured with the use of some basic design knowledge. An easy example would be the use of a header hierarchy, 
which none of the pages really used. This could easily have made both the websites seem more intuitive. </p>
