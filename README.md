GLOSEBERG
=========

### How to run

The site is hosted at [woz.no](http://gloseberg.woz.no). If you want to setup your own local version you need to install [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) on your computer/server. Since the site is implemented using flask, you need to run the command:

'''bash
pip3 install Flask
'''

This will install a local version. If you don't want flask to be installed globally, it's possible to setup the server environment with [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). 

### Technologies

We have used the following technologies to implement our project:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Flask (based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2)
